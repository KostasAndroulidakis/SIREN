# SIREN

![SIREN Logo](siren-logo.png)

A minimal radar system built from first principles.

An ultrasonic sensor sweeps 180 degrees on a servo motor, measuring distances.

The Arduino transmits data through a C++ backend to a C++ frontend.

Military-grade aspirations within consumer hardware constraints.

Simple components, precise measurements, real-time visualization.
